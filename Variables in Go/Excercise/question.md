# Exercise: Simple Shopping Cart

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with creating a simple shopping cart program that performs the following tasks:

- Declare and initialize variables to store the following information:
  - The name of the product (string)
  - The price of the product (float64)
  - The quantity of the product (int)
  - A boolean indicating if the product is in stock
- Calculate the total cost of the items in the cart (price \* quantity) and print it.
- If the product is not in stock, print a message indicating that the item is unavailable.
- Use appropriate variable names and comments to explain your code.

## Requirements

- Ensure that your program compiles and runs without errors.
- Use basic variable types (string, int, float64, bool) for this exercise.
